For 144 years the church existed as a small community church, predominantly serving those living in and near the Hawk Creek area of Laurel County, Kentucky. In the early days, the average attendance ranged from 50 to 100 people.</p><p>In 2005, God began a fresh move that brought revival and expanded the churches borders to reach throughout Laurel County, the region and into the world. Today, God is radically transforming and rebuilding lives at Hawk Creek. Since 2005, over 1000 people have been baptized and come to develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Through the dynamic presentation of God’s unchanging word and the hands of His people, addictions have been shattered, broken marriages have been rebuilt and lives have been reborn.</p><p>In February 2011, we moved into a new, state-of-the-art building located on a 40-acre campus in the London-Laurel County Industrial Park.

Through the providence of God, the Word of God has been protected and preserved, and is the only infallible and authoritative rule of faith and practice. – 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:20-21; Psalm 119:11, 89, 105\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>GOD</strong>: We believe there is only One true, eternally existent God. He exists in three co-equal persons – Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. The triune God is the Creator and Sustainer of all things, and is worthy of worship and obedience. – Deuteronomy. 6:4-5; Genesis 1:31, Luke 3:21-22; Matthew 28:18-20\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>JESUS CHRIST:</strong> We believe that Jesus Christ is God. He was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of a virgin, lived a sinless life, performed miracles, shed His blood on the cross to pay the debt for our sins, was buried, bodily resurrected, ascended to the right hand of the Father, and will return literally, visibly, and personally in glory and power. – Matthew 1:18-23; Philippians 2:5-11; 1 Corinthians 15:1-8.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>HOLY SPIRIT:</strong> We believe that the Holy Spirit is God, Co-equal and Co-existent with the Father and the Son. He is the Chief Convictor of sin and the Chief Agent of regeneration and sanctification. The Holy Spirit lives within every believer and empowers every believer to live a godly life. – John 14:16-17; 16:7-15; 1 Corinthians 6:19-20; Romans 8:9-11.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>SALVATION:</strong> We believe salvation is a free gift of God’s grace apart from human works, based solely upon Christ’s atoning death, received only through faith in the person and finished work of Jesus Christ on the cross and His resurrection from death. – Ephesians 2:8-10; Acts 16:31.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE CHURCH:</strong> We believe the church is the body of Christ and family of God. It is made up of saved and baptized believers, who regularly join together for worship, fellowship, and ministry. – Matthew 16:15-19; I Corinthians 12:12-14; Hebrews 10:25.\r\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>EVANGELISM:</strong> We believe that it is the responsibility and privilege of every Christian to proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ and to seek to make growing disciples. – Matthew 28:18-20; Acts 1:8.\r\n</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 18:07:36','2015-05-20 15:07:54','33fdc3b2-57bd-466e-a046-c5f70754fcf3'),(31,30,'en_us','What to Expect',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 18:07:59','2015-05-13 18:07:59','12b40aed-730b-40fd-a666-fade30f71251'),(32,31,'en_us','Our Story',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 18:08:19','2015-05-13 18:08:19','844255ac-95c1-4f0a-a56b-b78a02f8597e'),(34,33,'en_us','What We Believe',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 18:09:14','2015-05-19 18:26:32','51a64950-c889-4c12-aed8-a357d1cb08ba'),(35,34,'en_us','Services & Locations','<p><strong>London Weekly Activities</strong><br></p><p> Weekend Services – Sunday @ 9:30AM, 11:15AM<br> The Creek Kids – Sunday @ 9:30AM, 11:15AM<br> Fusion Students – Wednesday @ 6:30 PM<br> Celebrate Recovery – Tuesday @ 6:00 PM\r\n</p><p><strong>Location</strong><br> The Creek Church<br> 75 Capital Drive<br> London, KY 40741<br> (Off Industrial Blvd / Hwy 80 West)<br> See <a href=\"http://hawkcreekchurch.com/maps\">Map &amp; Directions</a>\r\n</p><p><strong>Somerset Weekly Activities</strong><br> Weekend Services – Sunday @ 10:00 AM<br> The Creek Kids – Sunday @ 10:00 AM<br> Fusion Students – Wednesday @ 6:30 PM\r\n</p><p><strong>Location</strong><br> The Center for Rural Development<br> 2292 South Highway 27<br> Somerset, KY 42501<br> See <a href=\"http://hawkcreekchurch.com/somerset-map\">Map &amp; Directions</a>\r\n</p><p><strong>Church Office &amp; Delivery Address</strong><br> The Creek Church<br> 504 North Broad Street<br> London, KY 40741<br> Phone: 606.877.9682<br> Email: <a href=\"mailto:info@thecreekchurch.com\">info@thecreekchurch.com</a>\r\n</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 18:09:37','2015-05-15 21:45:29','8f09ec95-1b68-4b2e-8867-4ec4cbf08030'),(36,35,'en_us','Services & Locations',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 18:10:13','2015-05-13 18:10:13','a1a89057-43e8-40d5-8bb0-a1831ebcb9e4'),(37,36,'en_us','Next Steps',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'',NULL,NULL,'2015-05-13 18:13:05','2015-05-13 18:13:05','11f7897d-e269-4867-8f1c-196a8b3a0b73'),(38,37,'en_us','Baptism','<p>Are you a follower of Jesus Christ?

And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.” (Matthew 28:19-20)\r\n</p><p><strong>It demonstrates that I am a Believer.<br> </strong>“And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.” (1 John 2:3)\r\n</p><p><strong>2 – WHAT IS THE MEANING OF BAPTISM?</strong>\r\n</p><p><strong>To illustrate Christ’s death, burial and resurrection.<br> </strong>“Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures” (1 Corinthians 15:3-4)\r\n</p><p>“Having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.” (Colossians 2:12)\r\n</p><p><strong>To illustrate my new life as a Christian.<br> </strong>“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.” (2 Corinthians 5:17)\r\n</p><p>“We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.” (Romans 6:4)\r\n</p><p><strong>3 – IS BAPTISM NECESSARY FOR SALVATION?</strong>\r\n</p><p><strong>No, baptism doesn’t make you a Christian.<br> </strong>Only your faith in Christ makes you a Christian. Baptism is a public sign of the commitment you have made to follow Jesus Christ.\r\n</p><p>“For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.” (Ephesians 2:8-9)\r\n</p><p><strong>4 – WHY BE BAPTIZED BY IMMERSION?</strong>\r\n</p><p><strong>Because Jesus was baptized by immersion.<br> </strong>“And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water…” (Matthew 3:16)\r\n</p><p><strong>Every baptism in the Bible was by immersion.<br> </strong>For example: “And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.” (Acts 8:38)\r\n</p><p><strong>The word “baptize” comes from the Greek word “baptizo” which means “to dip” or “to immerse” under water.</strong>\r\n</p><p><strong>It best symbolizes a burial and resurrection<br> </strong>As a person being baptized goes under water, he/she is identifying with the death of and burial of Christ. As he/she comes up out of the water, he/she is identifying with the resurrection of Christ. (see Romans 6:1-11)\r\n</p><p><strong> 5 – WHO SHOULD BE BAPTIZED?</strong>\r\n</p><p><strong>Every person who has believed in Jesus Christ.<br> </strong>“So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.” (Acts 2:41)\r\n</p><p>“But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.” (Acts 8:12)<br> <strong><br> The one requirement for baptism is belief in Christ.<br> </strong>A Believer is someone who has realized that their sin separated them from God. They have given up all efforts to reach God through good works or religious activity. They have concluded that Jesus Christ’s death on the cross for their sins is the only thing that can bridge the gap between them and God. A Believer is someone who has decided to trust Christ alone for their salvation. If you have come to that point in your spiritual journey, then you are ready to be baptized.\r\n</p><p><strong>6 – WHEN SHOULD I BE BAPTIZED?</strong>\r\n</p><p><strong>As soon as you believe.<br> </strong>Acts 8:12 says: “But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.”\r\n</p><p>This doesn’t have to be immediately but the Bible teaches that baptism should follow your decision to become a Believer. There is no reason to delay. If you wait until you are “good” enough, you will never feel ready for baptism.\r\n</p><p><strong>7 – WHAT ABOUT BEING BAPTIZED TWICE?<br> </strong>The Creek Church recommends being baptized again if you have not been baptized by immersion since you became a Believer in Christ. It does not devalue a prior experience but simply reflects your desire to be baptized in the same way Jesus was baptized.\r\n</p><p><strong>8 – WHAT DO I WEAR TO BE BAPTIZED?<br> </strong>Dress in clothes you don’t mind getting wet. We will give you a dark shirt to wear and recommend shorts. Be sure to bring a change of dry clothes to wear home. There is a changing room available. We will provide you with a towel but recommend you also bring one from home. Arrive 30 minutes before the service is scheduled to begin for some final instructions.\r\n</p><p><strong>9 – HOW DO I SIGN UP TO BE BAPTIZED?<br> </strong>You can sign up to be baptized by contacting Ron Green at <a href=\"mailto:ron@thecreekchurch.com\">ron@thecreekchurch.com</a> or 606.877.9682.\r\n</p>',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'#ffffff','2015-05-13 18:13:46','2015-05-20 14:36:33','14146403-cc26-4d3e-b64a-a372816dbda2'),(39,38,'en_us','Membership','<p>There are three ways to become a member of The Creek Church:</p><p><strong>Baptism:</strong> This means you have received Jesus Christ as your savior and are ready to identify with Him publicly by being baptized by immersion in water.</p> <p><strong>Transfer of a Letter of Membership:</strong> This means you have received Jesus Christ as your savior, been baptized by immersion, and are a member of another Baptist church.</p> <p><strong>Statement of Faith:</strong> This means you have received Jesus Christ as your savior and been baptized by immersion.

That’s why our kids’ activities are broken into age-based environments designed to meet the unique needs of your child.</p><p><strong>KidsCove (birth – Kindergarten)</strong> uses the <em>First Look </em>curriculum<em> </em>to give preschoolers a first impression of their loving heavenly Father. KidsCove keeps learning simple and fun, repeating one basic truth about God all month long. By the time a child graduates KidsCove, he/she should believe three key things: God made me, God loves me and Jesus wants to be my friend forever.</p><p><strong>KidsCreek (1<sup>st</sup> – 5<sup>th</sup> grade)</strong> is designed to take elementary-aged children on a fun, engaging journey of biblical learning. KidsCreek uses the <em>252 Basics</em> curriculum and incorporates live worship, large group teaching, drama and small groups. All components of KidsCreek teach children how to apply Biblical concepts and stories to everyday life.</p><p>Our children’s activities take place during our Sunday morning services.

We will ask you to provide some information about your family that we will use to place your child in our electronic check-in system. Once you are checked-in, one of our volunteers will show you to your child’s room.</p><p>You and your child will receive matching identification tags that are unique to your family and your visit. Your child will receive a name tag to wear, which includes a 4-digit number that matches the pick-up tag you receive. During check-out, you will return to your child’s room and show your pick-up tag in order for your child to be released back to you.</p><p><strong>What are your safety procedures?</strong><br> Security is a top priority for KidsCove and KidsCreek. All children are electronically checked-in, and foot traffic to children’s rooms is limited to ensure complete safety for all children. We also keep our child-to-volunteer ratio low in order to ensure the physical safety of each child. All volunteers working with children are required to complete a background check.</p><p><strong>What if my child needs me during the worship service?</strong><br> If you are needed during the worship service, the 4-digit code on your pick-up tag will appear on the screens in the auditorium. When you see your child’s code, immediately exit the auditorium and head to the KidsCove check-in desk. One of our team members will direct you to your child’s room.</p><p><strong>What should I expect as a regular attendee?</strong><br> Each week you will come to the kids check-in area, which opens 20 minutes before the start of each service. To check-in your child, use one of our touch screens to enter the last 7-digits of the phone number used to register your child.</p><p>You and your child will receive matching identification tags that are unique to your family and your visit.

The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.\\u201d (2 Corinthians 5:17)<\\/p><p>\\u201cWe were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.\\u201d (Romans 6:4)<\\/p><p><strong>3 \\u2013 IS BAPTISM NECESSARY FOR SALVATION?<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong>No, baptism doesn\\u2019t make you a Christian.<br> <\\/strong>Only your faith in Christ makes you a Christian. Baptism is a public sign of the commitment you have made to follow Jesus Christ.<\\/p><p>\\u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\\u201d (Ephesians 2:8-9)<\\/p><p><strong>4 \\u2013 WHY BE BAPTIZED BY IMMERSION?<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong>Because Jesus was baptized by immersion.<br> <\\/strong>\\u201cAnd when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water\\u2026\\u201d (Matthew 3:16)<\\/p><p><strong>Every baptism in the Bible was by immersion.<br> <\\/strong>For example: \\u201cAnd he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.\\u201d (Acts 8:38)<\\/p><p><strong>The word \\u201cbaptize\\u201d comes from the Greek word \\u201cbaptizo\\u201d which means \\u201cto dip\\u201d or \\u201cto immerse\\u201d under water.<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong>It best symbolizes a burial and resurrection<br> <\\/strong>As a person being baptized goes under water, he\\/she is identifying with the death of and burial of Christ. As he\\/she comes up out of the water, he\\/she is identifying with the resurrection of Christ. (see Romans 6:1-11)<\\/p><p><strong> 5 \\u2013 WHO SHOULD BE BAPTIZED?<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong>Every person who has believed in Jesus Christ.<br> <\\/strong>\\u201cSo those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.\\u201d (Acts 2:41)<\\/p><p>\\u201cBut when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\\u201d (Acts 8:12)<br> <strong><br> The one requirement for baptism is belief in Christ.<br> <\\/strong>A Believer is someone who has realized that their sin separated them from God. They have given up all efforts to reach God through good works or religious activity. They have concluded that Jesus Christ\\u2019s death on the cross for their sins is the only thing that can bridge the gap between them and God. A Believer is someone who has decided to trust Christ alone for their salvation. If you have come to that point in your spiritual journey, then you are ready to be baptized.<\\/p><p><strong>6 \\u2013 WHEN SHOULD I BE BAPTIZED?<\\/strong><\\/p><p><strong>As soon as you believe.<br> <\\/strong>Acts 8:12 says: \\u201cBut when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\\u201d<\\/p><p>This doesn\\u2019t have to be immediately but the Bible teaches that baptism should follow your decision to become a Believer. There is no reason to delay. If you wait until you are \\u201cgood\\u201d enough, you will never feel ready for baptism.<\\/p><p><strong>7 \\u2013 WHAT ABOUT BEING BAPTIZED TWICE?<br> <\\/strong>The Creek Church recommends being baptized again if you have not been baptized by immersion since you became a Believer in Christ. It does not devalue a prior experience but simply reflects your desire to be baptized in the same way Jesus was baptized.<\\/p><p><strong>8 \\u2013 WHAT DO I WEAR TO BE BAPTIZED?<br> <\\/strong>Dress in clothes you don\\u2019t mind getting wet. We will give you a dark shirt to wear and recommend shorts. Be sure to bring a change of dry clothes to wear home. There is a changing room available.

Baptism is a public sign of the commitment you have made to follow Jesus Christ.\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\u201cFor by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God, not a result of works, so that no one may boast.\\u201d (Ephesians 2:8-9)\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>4 \\u2013 WHY BE BAPTIZED BY IMMERSION?<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>Because Jesus was baptized by immersion.<br> <\\/strong>\\u201cAnd when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water\\u2026\\u201d (Matthew 3:16)\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>Every baptism in the Bible was by immersion.<br> <\\/strong>For example: \\u201cAnd he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.\\u201d (Acts 8:38)\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>The word \\u201cbaptize\\u201d comes from the Greek word \\u201cbaptizo\\u201d which means \\u201cto dip\\u201d or \\u201cto immerse\\u201d under water.<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>It best symbolizes a burial and resurrection<br> <\\/strong>As a person being baptized goes under water, he\\/she is identifying with the death of and burial of Christ. As he\\/she comes up out of the water, he\\/she is identifying with the resurrection of Christ. (see Romans 6:1-11)\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong> 5 \\u2013 WHO SHOULD BE BAPTIZED?<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>Every person who has believed in Jesus Christ.<br> <\\/strong>\\u201cSo those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.\\u201d (Acts 2:41)\\r\\n<\\/p><p>\\u201cBut when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\\u201d (Acts 8:12)<br> <strong><br> The one requirement for baptism is belief in Christ.<br> <\\/strong>A Believer is someone who has realized that their sin separated them from God. They have given up all efforts to reach God through good works or religious activity. They have concluded that Jesus Christ\\u2019s death on the cross for their sins is the only thing that can bridge the gap between them and God. A Believer is someone who has decided to trust Christ alone for their salvation. If you have come to that point in your spiritual journey, then you are ready to be baptized.\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>6 \\u2013 WHEN SHOULD I BE BAPTIZED?<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>As soon as you believe.<br> <\\/strong>Acts 8:12 says: \\u201cBut when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.\\u201d\\r\\n<\\/p><p>This doesn\\u2019t have to be immediately but the Bible teaches that baptism should follow your decision to become a Believer. There is no reason to delay. If you wait until you are \\u201cgood\\u201d enough, you will never feel ready for baptism.\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>7 \\u2013 WHAT ABOUT BEING BAPTIZED TWICE?<br> <\\/strong>The Creek Church recommends being baptized again if you have not been baptized by immersion since you became a Believer in Christ. It does not devalue a prior experience but simply reflects your desire to be baptized in the same way Jesus was baptized.\\r\\n<\\/p><p><strong>8 \\u2013 WHAT DO I WEAR TO BE BAPTIZED?<br> <\\/strong>Dress in clothes you don\\u2019t mind getting wet.

has accepted christ should be baptized by water immersion if you are a follower of christ but have never been baptized by immersion you are invited and encouraged to do so at our next going public service to be included in our next going public service contact london campus ron green at ron thecreekchurch com or 606 877 9682 somerset campus rocky ryser at rocky thecreekchurch com or 606 682 3625 for more information on what we teach about baptism check out some of the frequently asked questions faqs below baptism faq 1 why should i be baptized to follow the example set by christ in those days jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized by john in the jordan mark 1 9 because christ commanded it go therefore and make disciples of all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit teaching them to observe all that i have commanded you and behold i am with you always to the end of the age matthew 28 19 20 it demonstrates that i am a believer and by this we know that we have come to know him if we keep his commandments 1 john 2 3 2 what is the meaning of baptism to illustrate christ s death burial and resurrection christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures that he was buried that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures 1 corinthians 15 3 4 having been buried with him in baptism in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of god who raised him from the dead colossians 2 12 to illustrate my new life as a christian therefore if anyone is in christ he is a new creation the old has passed away behold the new has come 2 corinthians 5 17 we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death in order that just as christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the father we too might walk in newness of life romans 6 4 3 is baptism necessary for salvation no baptism doesn t make you a christian only your faith in christ makes you a christian baptism is a public sign of the commitment you have made to follow jesus christ for by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of god not a result of works so that no one may boast ephesians 2 8 9 4 why be baptized by immersion because jesus was baptized by immersion and when jesus was baptized immediately he went up from the water matthew 3 16 every baptism in the bible was by immersion for example and he commanded the chariot to stop and they both went down into the water philip and the eunuch and he baptized him acts 8 38 the word baptize comes from the greek word baptizo which means to dip or to immerse under water it best symbolizes a burial and resurrection as a person being baptized goes under water he she is identifying with the death of and burial of christ as he she comes up out of the water he she is identifying with the resurrection of christ see romans 6 1 11 5 who should be baptized every person who has believed in jesus christ so those who received his word were baptized and there were added that day about three thousand souls acts 2 41 but when they believed philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women acts 8 12 the one requirement for baptism is belief in christ a believer is someone who has realized that their sin separated them from god they have given up all efforts to reach god through good works or religious activity they have concluded that jesus christ s death on the cross for their sins is the only thing that can bridge the gap between them and god a believer is someone who has decided to trust christ alone for their salvation if you have come to that point in your spiritual journey then you are ready to be baptized 6 when should i be baptized as soon as you believe acts 8 12 says but when they believed philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of god and the name of jesus christ they were baptized both men and women this doesn t have to be immediately but the bible teaches that baptism should follow your decision to become a believer there is no reason to delay if you wait until you are good enough you will never feel ready for baptism 7 what about being baptized twice the creek church recommends being baptized again if you have not been baptized by immersion since you became a believer in christ it does not devalue a prior experience but simply reflects your desire to be baptized in the same way jesus was baptized 8 what do i wear to be baptized dress in clothes you don t mind getting wet we will give you a dark shirt to wear and recommend shorts be sure to bring a change of dry clothes to wear home there is a changing room available we will provide you with a towel but recommend you also bring one from home arrive 30 minutes before the service is scheduled to begin for some final instructions 9 how do i sign up to be baptized you can sign up to be baptized by
